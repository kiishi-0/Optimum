				<h1 class="text1">About Us</h1>
				<p class="text2">The company was incorporated and started business in 1984 under the name “KLINSITE OUTDOOR SERVICES LIMITED” mainly to provide conventional outdoor advertising services to various clients and advertising agencies.
				The first eight years of operation was enough time for the company to grow and become the second biggest outdoor advertising company in Nigeria.
				However in 1992, a need arose for a radical change in focus due to the yearnings of our clients for innovation in outdoor advertising practice. This not only led to a change in our name to OPTIMUM EXPOSURES LIMITED, but also led to a total re-organisation and a complete change in focus. All these have launched the company into entirely new outdoor advertising multi-media. We believe this is where the future lies.
				Optimum Exposures Limited has become known and respected as an innovative company in the Nigeria Outdoor Advertising industry.
				This achievement was made possible by the company’s huge investment in Research and Development of new outdoor advertising and display products coupled with our belonging to a foremost Marketing Communications group - The Troyka Holdings

			<h2>Our Business</h2>
			<p>Outdoor advertising is essentially a mode of marketing communication whereby Advertisers are able to relay marketing information to prospective consumers by way of display once they are outside the four walls of their homes.
			Outdoor advertising involves the development and maintenance of strategically located display panels which provides optimal visibility to vehicular and human traffic. Outdoor companies normally invest huge sums of money to develop a network of display sites and panels which are then leased out to advertisers through advertising agencies or directly for a specific period of time. Once the tenor of a particular advertiser expires at any given location, the outdoor advertising company may lease out the same spot to any other interested client.
			The cost of investment in outdoor advertising business is usually recovered over a couple of years after which the investor is expected to start making substantial gains on the sites.
			The sole rights for regulating the practice of outdoor advertising are vested in the Local Government Councils nationwide while professional ethics are regulated by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria – APCON established under decree No55 of 1988. The umbrella body that coordinates and organises the activities of Outdoor Advertising Companies in Nigeria is called the Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN).
			OAAN is one of the sectoral bodies under APCON.

				<h3>Operational</h3>
				<p>
					The general scope of operations of an outdoor advertising company is to select, erect and service billboards at various locations as agreed with the clients. The responsibility of selecting ensures that the locations are strategic and viable for the audience being targeted. The placement of the billboard is a configuration of its size and the existing environmental features. Usually, the visual attraction of the billboard in terms of their aesthetic values should greatly enhance the beauty of the urban scene.

Rental rates for conventional outdoor advertising billboards such as 40 sheet, 16 sheet, bulletin boards, street directional signs and 4 sheet are usually determined and regulated by the Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN).
					The rental rates for unique billboards designed and introduced by an individual company within the association are usually determined by the company that introduces such unique boards e.g. – Optimum Exposures introduced the “Spectaculars” and the rental rates are determined by Optimum Exposures only.
