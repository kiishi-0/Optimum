                    <p>Biodun Shobanjo started his communications career with the Nigerian Broadcasting
                    Corporation where he worked for seven years in the Programmes Department.
                    He later joined the Client Service Department of Grant Advertising. He was appointed to the
                    Board after four and a half years and served as Deputy Managing Director for another four years.
                    In 1980, his vision of establishing a marketing communication company that will help revolutionise
                    the relationship between the Nigerian consumer and the advertisers' brands came to fruition with the 
                    formation of Insight Communications. He has since then run the company with a team of dynamic directors 
                    and first-class managers who have been able to set new standards of advertising excellence in the industry.
                    A highly trained and experienced man himself, Biodun's belief in sound, strategically focused training has made the Agency a 
                    dear partner to many blue-chip companies in Nigeria and has also bred a fine crop of communication professionals.
